/* 

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).


Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

With functions you can reuse code
You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
