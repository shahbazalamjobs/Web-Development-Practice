## var, let, const

- var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped, meaning they have different visibility levels.
- var allows variable hoisting, which means it can be used before declaration, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
- let allows reassignment of variables, while const does not permit reassignment, though it allows modifying object properties.
- Using let and const is recommended in modern JavaScript as they provide better scoping and more predictable behavior, 
reducing bugs and making code easier to understand.
