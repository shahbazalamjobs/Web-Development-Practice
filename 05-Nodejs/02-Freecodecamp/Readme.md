## NodeJs

1. **Node as an Environment:**
   - Node allows running JavaScript code "Outside the web browser."
   - It provides an environment for executing JavaScript on servers and other non-browser contexts.

2. **Node's Role:**
   - Node acts as an intermediary, taking JavaScript code and executing it using its runtime environment.

3. **Use of Google's V8 Engine:**
   - Node utilizes Google's V8 Engine to convert JavaScript code into machine code.
   - V8 Engine is a high-performance JavaScript engine used in various applications, including browsers.

4. **Access Limitations:**
   - Node lacks access to browser-specific features like the DOM, window object, and localStorage.
   - You can't use functions like `document.querySelector()` or `alert()` in Node as they pertain to browser interactions.

5. **Server-Side vs. Client-Side:**
   - Node is designed for server-side programming, whereas browser features are used for client-side programming.
   - Node is used to build server applications, APIs, and backend services.

6. **Key Distinction:**
   - Node extends the capabilities of JavaScript beyond browsers, making it suitable for various server-related tasks.

7. **JavaScript Execution:**
   - Node executes JavaScript code independently of the browser, enabling broader application possibilities.

8. **Error Example:**
   - Attempting to use browser-specific functions in Node will result in errors, emphasizing the distinction between server and client contexts.
